    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This dish is a sweet and savory dish that can be made for one, or the
      whole family. I have recently decided I wanted to cut out meats from my
      diet and thus looks towards a pescatarian diet. This recipe is one of my
      favorites as it features a good mix of food groups, is nutritious, and is
      filling!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup of sesame oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
      <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>6oz salmon steaks x 4</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds,
        ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low
        heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside
        1/2 cup of marinade for basting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add salmon
        steaks, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag.
        Marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil salmon steaks under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes, brushing
        salmon with reserved marinade. Turn and continue to broil until salmon
        is opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more minutes. Brush with marinade.
