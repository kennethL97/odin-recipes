    <h2 class="head">Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a famous dish popularized in Thailand. Although the recipe varies
      from cook to cook and region to region, this is a good attempt at
      recreating what I ate from Thai-owned hole-in-the-wall restaurants in
      Okinawa, Japan. Key to the flavor are the sugar levels, unsalted peanuts,
      peanut oil, and either oyster or fish sauce.

      <li>2 tablespoons tamarind pulp</li>
      <li>12 ounce package dried rice noodles x 1</li>
      <li>cold water, as needed</li>
      <li>½ cup peanut oil</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>12 ounces chicken breast, cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups dry-roasted, unsalted peanuts</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried ground Asian radish</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped fresh chives</li>
      <li>2 cups fresh bean sprouts</li>
      <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="head">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together rice wine vinegar, 1/2 cup sugar, oyster sauce, and
        tamarind pulp in a saucepan over medium heat until sugar dissolves,
        about 5 minutes; remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place rice noodles in a large bowl and pour enough cold water to cover
        noodles. Allow to soften, about 10 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Cook and
        stir eggs and garlic in hot oil until eggs are softly cooked, 2 to 3
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir chicken and noodles into eggs and cook until chicken is no longer
        pink in the center and juices run clear, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour rice wine vinegar sauce, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 1/2
        teaspoons salt into the noodle mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir peanuts, ground radish, and chili powder into noodle mixture; cook
        until peanuts soften slightly, about 5 minutes. Add more sugar or chili
        powder if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and toss chives with noodle mixture. Top with bean
        sprouts and garnish with lime wedges.
      </li>
